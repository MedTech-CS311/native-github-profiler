# Native Github Profiler

In this exercise, we will create a mobile version for the [Github Profiler](https://github.com/MedTech-CS311/github-profiler/tree/redux) application.

### Steps

- [ ] Create the `.env` file that will hold your API token
- [ ] Create a directory called `Screens` and create the needed components
- [ ] Bring the implementation code from the web app and adapt it to React Native
- [ ] Create a directory called `redux` and create the **store** with the needed **actions** and **reducers** for `profile` and `repos` slices
- [ ] Create a navigation between the 2 screens (profile / repos)

### Advanced: Organisations feature

- [ ] Create another screen that will hold the organisations of the user
- [ ] Create another tab for the new screen
- [ ] Implement the needed redux logic to fetch the organisationsList from [github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/orgs)
